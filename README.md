# USDT/USDC Arbitrage Trading Bot for MEXC

Hello everyone! Iâ€™ve developed a spot arbitrage trading bot specifically for the USDT/USDC pair on MEXC Exchange.

## How It Works

The bot's core logic is simple yet effective: it buys USDT when the price reaches **0.9999** and sells when it hits **1**. It operates within a spread of **0.9995 - 1.0005**, continuously making small trades and distributing your funds within this range. Each successful trade generates a small profit, and since the funds remain in MEXC, they also benefit from the exchange's flexible interest rates.

### Estimated Profits

Based on a month of operation, the estimated monthly profit is around **9%**. Below is a sample of profit records:

- 2024/8/9 - 3331.19
- 2024/8/10 - 3336.14
- 2024/8/11 - 3348.84
- 2024/9/9 - 3565.54
- ... (other entries)
